> I know there is not a lot of source info about the biology of anything in TES, but I have been trying to figure out the Emperor Parasols (mushroom trees). In the real world, mushrooms are temporary structures, grown expressly for releasing spores from the mycelium below, which is the persistent part of the organism that derives energy from decomposition. After the spores are released, the mushroom rots away. Trees are the opposite -- they are long lived, and they are the primary part of the organism. The reason they grow tall is to compete with other plants for sunlight.

> So why do the Emperor Parasols of Morrowind grow tall woody structures? Perhaps the caps are temporary, but regrow from the same stem during each reproductive season, or perhaps they have developed the ability to produce and release successive batches of spore from the same structure. As for why they would need to be so tall for spore dispersal, I am unsure if their height would help with wider dispersion on the wind.

> Perhaps more importantly, what are the Emperor Parasols are decomposing that they have enough energy to construct such massive mushrooms? Two of the three regions they are found in (Azura's Coast and Sheogorad) seem sparse, and even The Ascadian Isles do not seem that dense in biomatter to decompose. Perhaps the giant mushrooms are part of some alternate energy production system. They could be photosynthetic (possibly with the help of sybiotic algae, like lichen), or perhaps they decompose magicka (or would that just be photosynthesis by another name in TES, as the sun is literally a hole through which magicka enters the world?), or the energies emanating from the Heart, which would also explain their exclusivity to Morrowind.
